# 🤟 Sign Language Detection

This is the **Final Project** for the NTI AI Track, completed after 2 months of intensive training in **Artificial Intelligence**, where I gained solid foundations in **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)**.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a **Sign Language Detection App** that can recognize sign language letters from images in real-time.  
The app is deployed using **Streamlit** so it can be accessed and tested interactively.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Preprocessing & Data Augmentation for robust training.  
- Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).  
- Fine-tuning for improved accuracy.  
- Streamlit web interface for real-time predictions.
